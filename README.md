Project Title: House Hunt-Finding your perfect Rental Home

Objective: The goal of House Hunt is to create an easy-to-use platform for property rentals that balances functionality and design. It’s built with scalability and real-world use in mind, serving as both a learning project and a potential foundation for a larger rental service platform.

Project Description: House Hunt is a modern full-stack web application designed to help users search for, discover, and book homes or rental properties—much like Airbnb. The platform connects property owners with people looking for short-term or long-term stays, offering a seamless and intuitive experience for both hosts and guests. A clean and responsive frontend that mimics the Airbnb homepage design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
